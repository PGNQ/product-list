****************************

The front-end React App assumes a database exists with product data. Start-up procedures are:

1. Type "node server.js" into your terminal from inside the /product-list folder. 
2. Type "http://localhost:8000/generate-fake-data" into your browser to build a database of fake data to be used by the front-end app.
3. Type "npm start" into a second terminal window from inside the /product-list/front-end folder. This starts the UI.
